"""rfed channel proof-of-work stamp contract.

A rfed SEND payload ends with an optional 32-byte proof-of-work stamp bound to
the bytes it accompanies. The stamp material and value semantics are fixed by
``RFed/SPEC.md`` "PoW STAMP CONTRACT"::

    material     = channel_hash(16) ‖ inner_blob      # payload[..len-STAMP_SIZE]
    transient_id = SHA-256(material)
    workblock    = LXStamper::stamp_workblock(transient_id, STAMP_EXPAND_ROUNDS=16)
    value        = leading_zero_bits(SHA-256(workblock ‖ stamp))
    valid        = value >= stamp_cost

The workblock, stamp generation, and validation semantics are the **standard
LXMF** ones — byte-compatible with Python LXMF's ``LXMF.LXStamper`` and
``@reticulum/core``'s ``lxmf/stamper.js`` — run at rfed's 16 expansion rounds.
The workblock is the memory-hard HKDF expansion: the concatenation of
``rounds`` chunks of 256 bytes each, where chunk ``n`` is
``HKDF-SHA256(ikm=transient_id, salt=SHA-256(transient_id ‖ msgpack(n)), L=256)``
(4096 bytes at rfed's 16 rounds). Stamp generation mirrors LXMF's random-trial
search; validation is value-based, so the trial strategy does not affect
interoperability.

.. note::

   An interim ``reticulum-rust`` ``LXStamper`` was an incompatible stub: its
   workblock was ``SHA-256`` iterated ``rounds + 1`` times over the transient
   id — a 32-byte value, not the memory-hard HKDF expansion — so this module
   briefly mirrored that stub to interoperate with live rfed nodes. The stub
   was fixed upstream (https://github.com/jrl290/Reticulum-rust/pull/2), and
   both ``reticulum-rust`` and ``@reticulum/core`` now use the standard LXMF
   workblock, so stamps minted by either side cross-validate with Python LXMF
   and fixed Rust nodes. Stamps generated against the old stub workblock are
   no longer valid (nor are ours on unfixed Rust nodes) — a protocol-level
   change, not an API one.

``stamp_cost`` is owned by the ``/rfed/subscribe`` reply: a cost of ``0`` (or
``None``) means stamping is disabled and no stamp is required or appended.
