"""RFed (Reticulum Federation) wire-format constants.

Mirrors the canonical wire format in ``RFed/SPEC.md`` ("CANONICAL WIRE FORMAT
— ULTIMATE AUTHORITY") and ``@reticulum/core``'s ``src/rfed/constants.js``.
These values are protocol-invariant: any change silently breaks
interoperability with the Rust ``rfed`` reference node and the JavaScript
``@reticulum/core`` ``RFedClient``.
