"""Deterministic rfed channel derivation.

A channel is a deterministic :class:`RNS.Identity` derived from a plain-text
channel name. Any party that knows the name independently arrives at the same
identity hash ("channel hash") and keypair, so senders can encrypt to the
channel and subscribers can decrypt — with no server-side registration.

Algorithm (``RFed/SPEC.md`` §1)::

    seed          = SHA-256(channel_name)                 → 32 bytes
    x25519_priv   = seed
    ed25519_priv   = seed
    x25519_pub    = X25519_public_key(seed)               → 32 bytes
    ed25519_pub   = Ed25519_public_key(seed)              → 32 bytes
    bundle        = x25519_pub ‖ ed25519_pub              → 64 bytes
    channel_hash  = SHA-256(bundle)[0..16]                → 16 bytes

The channel's private-key bundle is ``seed ‖ seed`` (the same 32-byte
``SHA-256(name)`` scalar used for both X25519 and Ed25519), matching the Rust
reference's ``private_key_bundle = seed || seed`` and the canonical Python
``channel_hash.compute_channel_hash`` vectors.

This module uses :mod:`RNS` only for its cryptography primitives
(:func:`RNS.Identity.full_hash` / :func:`RNS.Identity.truncated_hash`), so it
works **without a running Reticulum** — only :class:`~RNS.Destination` creation
needs a live transport.
