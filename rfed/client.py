"""rfed channel client — subscribe, publish, receive, and pull against a rfed
federation node.

Speaks the modern split rfed destinations (``RFed/SPEC.md`` §2), all sharing
the node's single identity:

  - ``rfed.channel.subscribe`` — ``/rfed/subscribe`` request (caches stamp cost)
  - ``rfed.channel.unsubscribe`` — ``/rfed/unsubscribe`` request
  - ``rfed.channel.publish``   — fire-and-forget publish (a single DATA packet,
    or a Resource over a link for payloads beyond the link MDU)
  - ``rfed.channel.pull``      — ``/rfed/pull`` paging (caller-identified)

Delivery arrives on the client's own inbound ``rfed.delivery`` destination as a
fanout payload ``[ channel_hash(16) ‖ inner_blob ]``, which is split and fed to
:func:`rfed.blob.unwrap_channel_message`.

This module is RNS-transport-dependent: it needs a running
:class:`RNS.Reticulum` (creating :class:`RNS.Destination` /
:class:`RNS.Link` requires an initialised transport). Construction itself is
offline-safe — destinations are created lazily inside each method. The pure
codec (:mod:`rfed.blob`, :mod:`rfed.channel`, :mod:`rfed.stamp`)
is testable without a running Reticulum.

Mirrors ``@reticulum/core``'s ``src/rfed/client.js``.
